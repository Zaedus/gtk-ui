# gtk-ui

The intention of Gtk UI is to strike a compromise between purely GUI based UI development using Glade, which is discouraged by GNOME devs, and pure text based development, which is slow especially in XML. 

## Examples

In the `examples/` directory, .gui files are Gtk UI and .ui are the transpiled results.
